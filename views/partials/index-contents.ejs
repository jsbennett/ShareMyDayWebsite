            Share My Day is a project focused on developing a mobile application allowing children who are unable to
            speak the opportunity to have a voice.
            <br><br>
            The project is centred around creating stories about a child's day at school using sensors, voice
            recordings and pictures about their day. The aim of the project is to be able to share the childâ€™s
            experiences. <br><br>
            The project aims to create an Android application in which a child, their parent and their teacher can use.
            <br><br>
            Briefly, the project will use Near Field Communication (NFC) cards as sensors. NFC cards are used to
            transfer data between a device. It has many applicable uses, most commonly used for contactless card
            payments. <br><br>
            Teachers will be able to create voice recordings to be able to add a personal narrative of the child to
            conversations. Furthermore, it is hoped that they will also be able to take pictures of the event, allowing
            the story to be even more personal.<br><br>
            The children will be able to give their opinion on the story, whether it was positive (they had fun and
            enjoyed it) or negative (they did not enjoy as much). They will also be able to mark stories as their
            favourite allowing this story to be accessed easier. When requested, the child will be able to have their
            story read out, allowing them to have an answer to the question: "How Was School Today?"<br>

            Share My Day is based on another project called "How Was School Today?"<br><br>
            The award winning project is centred around creating a story about a child's day at school.
            Realised in 2009, researchers from the University of Dundee and the University of Aberdeen found that there
            were inadequate systems for conversations with children with complex communication needs.<br><br> This new
            system
            however utilised the latest technology at the time, allowing the creation of a story about a child's day.
            They used Natural Language Generation (NLG), which creates sentences from data, and radio-frequency
            identification (RFID) swipe cards to record information about the child's day. This required clunky
            specialist equipment to record the information on the swipe cards. <br></br>
            This system was successful in allowing children with complex communication needs to finally to have a
            conversation about their day. Variations of the system included a companion mobile
            application, giving teachers the ability to create voice recordings and take pictures.<br><br>
            Now with the rise and development of smartphones, the specialist equipment is now embedded within the phone
            itself. Also, with the camera and recoring capabilities, it is now feasible for the features of the
            original
            "How Was School Today?" project and the mobile phone variant to be combined into a single smartphone
            application. <br><br>

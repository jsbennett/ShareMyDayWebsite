            Share My Day is a project focused on developing a mobile application allowing children who are unable to
            speak the opportunity to have a voice. <br><br>
            The project is centered around creating a story about a child's day at school. Through the use of sensors,
            voice recordings and pictures about their day, a story can be created.<br><br>
            The project aims to create an Android application in which a child, their parent and their teacher can use.
            <br><br>
            Breifly, the project will use Near Field Communication (NFC) cards as sensors. NFC cards are used to
            transfer data between a device. It has many applicable uses, most commonly used for contactless card
            payments. <br><br>
            Teachers will be able to create voice recordings to allow a in-depth description and further comments on
            events as they happen. Furthermore, it is hoped that they will also be able to take pictures of the event,
            allowing the story to be even more personal.<br>
